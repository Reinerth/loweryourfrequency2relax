About the application "loweryourfrequency2relax": 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This browser-app is a metronome. It can play and repeat a sound, 
that is put in the folder loweryourfrequency2relax\mvc\view\sound 
and its name was configured in the file usersettings.js in line 15 
(window.loweryourfrequency2relax.soundFile)

Meant to be used for meditation to calm down when feeling stressed, 
by playing a sound with a lower repeated frequency then seconds.
Yet, tested only with edge-browser Version 92.0.902.67 (Official build) (64-bit).

With the slider the repeating-time is adjustable,
in a timerange between 1 second and 60 seconds 
or one minute and 60 minutes. 
usersetttings.js in line 22 (window.loweryourfrequency2relax.unit)
